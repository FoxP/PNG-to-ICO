# PNG to ICO

## About
[KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) batch script to easily convert PNG, GIF, BMP, SVG or JPG images to multi-resolution [ICO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_(file_format)) files using [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php).  
Don't want to deal with Command Line or install a heavy, bloated program ? Well, you're in the right place !

## Usage

On Microsoft Windows, from File Explorer, right clic an image file or a folder containing image files, and select `PNG to ICO`.  
If you don't want to use the provided installer (`png_to_ico_setup.exe`), drag & drop a folder or an image to `png_to_ico.bat`.
